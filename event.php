                our Junior Triathletes. The swim is a shorter, more manageable 1/4 mile distance, (instead 
                of the standard 1/2-mile Sprint distance swim), 10 mile bike ride (vs 12 miles and it's a 
                2 loop course making it very spectator friendly!) and a flat 2 mile run (vs 3 mile sprint course).</p>
            <p><b>Half Marathon COURSE</b>: Half-Marathon (13.1-miles): Half-Marathon event starts and 
                finishes in the Athletes Village to the cheers of the enthusiastic crowd. Once 
                finished, runners can enjoy the finish line festivities, including the Sports & 
                Fitness Expo and live entertainment. Post-race refreshments will be provided and 
                the Awards Ceremony 
                for the Half-Marathon will begin once the results have been certified</p>
            <p><b>10k COURSE</b>: The 10K event starts and finishes in the Athletes Village. The 
                paths are approximately 6 ft wide, perfectly paved and wind around through the forest. 
                Each course has only two small hills with a minimal elevation gain to navigate and a fast 
                downhill to flat finish to the roaring cheers of the crowd.</p>

           <h3>What to Bring</h3>
            <p>Watch the weather closely. The show goes on no matter what the weather is doing.</p>

            <p>You must wear your chip timing piece during the entire event. You will 
                be given a band that will hold your chip timing piece around your ankle 
                throughout the entire event. Be sure that it is snapped tightly. 
                Be sure to have your Chip Timing piece on before you start the race 
                and be sure to step over the timing mats after each segment of the race. 
                If you are wearing a wet-suit, make sure the timing piece goes under 
                your wetsuit otherwise, you will have a very difficult time getting off your wet suit.</p>

            <p><b>Swim</b>: Wetsuits are optional for the swim but will provide buoyancy and warmth. 
                However, many people opt for no wetsuit for a triathlon so no worries. We will provide you
                with a swim cap but you will want to bring your own goggles.</p>

            <p><b>Bike</b>: A biking helmet is mandatory. You will also receive 2 stickers in your 
                package with your race number on them. The small sticker should go on the front of 
                your helmet. The bigger sticker will wrap around your bike frame. Road or mountain 
                bikes are acceptable. For safety reasons, be sure to have end-caps on the end of 
                your handle-bars.</p>
            <p><b>Run</b>: You must finish the race with your bib number on the front of you. 
                Some people choose to pin it on at the beginning of the race and have it on for 
                the whole event so they don't have to worry about it. Others pin it on a singlet 
                that they put on once they finish the swim before they head out for the bike. 
                Others use an elastic racing strap that they pin their bib number to and then 
                quickly strap it on before they leave for the run. Use whatever option feels best for you.</p>
             <p>Remember to bring a change of clothing so you can enjoy the post-event festivities.</p>
